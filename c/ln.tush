$ echo yo >yo

$ ../ln yo mama

This prints out the #links column and the filename column --
#links should be 2:

$ ls -l | awk '{print $2, $9}'
| 16 
| 2 mama
| 2 yo

$ ../ln
@ usage: ln from-file to-file
? 1

Here the complaint should say that it's 'nonesuch' that doesn't exist.
But we'd have to analyze the errno value to figure out which filename
to complain about, AFAIK; something for the TODO list:

$ ../ln nonesuch foo
@ ../ln: No such file or directory
? 1
